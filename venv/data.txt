Instead Apple took the body from the iPhone 6, 6S, 7 and 8, along with the 4.7-inch screen on those phones, and revamped it.
The new phone has an A13 Bionic processor, which is the same one used in the 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max.
But based on what Apple showed off this week, the new SE wisely follows the successful recipe for the original 2016 version, giving it a lot of promise.
In 2016, when Apple put the iPhone 6S's A9 processor and camera in the original SE, not every feature followed them over.
Rumored for months with different names, including iPhone 9 and SE 2, the budget phone essentially crams an iPhone 11 into an iPhone 8 body.
If you're in the unfortunate situation where you need a new phone or can't fix a damaged phone, today's announcement offers some relief.
There's also last year's Google Pixel 3A, which normally costs $399 and now sells for around $300.
